# JAWS Installation and Configuration

JAWS is still the most used screen reader in Switzerland. This is due historical reasons ans for its good compatibility to various office software. Therefore we test websites for use with JAWS and  NVDA.

Unfortunately, JAWS (Job Access With Speech) is quite expensive to buy. But there is a demo version you can download for free with limited runtime. You must restart your computer to reset the timer after 40 minutes of use. Another reason to set up your Accessibility Testing Environment on a Virtual Machine.

# JAWS installation

[Download JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS) and [install it, JAWS Quick Start:PDF download](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Content/Documents/Manuals/JAWS/JAWS-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf).

# Starting JAWS

Choose JAWS from the Desktop-Shortcut or start the application using the `jfw.exe` in its installation folder (.\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\18.0\jfw.exe).

# JAWS configuration

## Run from system tray

- To save space in the taskbar, JAWS should run in the system tray
- In JAWS, open `(Options)` â†’ `(B)asics`
- Select `Run JAWS from (S)ystem Tray`
- Click `OK` and restart JAWS
- From now on, you can access the JAWS features through `JAWS + J`
    - By default, the `JAWS` key is the `Insert` key (see [Screen readers are keyboard shortcut monsters](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/screen-readers-are-keyboard-shortcut-monsters){.page})

# Braille Viewer

- JAWS doesn't offer a `Speech Viewer` like NVDA, but at least its `Braille Viewer` gives some basic info about where JAWS' focus is at the moment
- More info here: [Re: Any JAWS equivalent to NVDA "Speech Viewer"?](http://webaim.org/discussion/mail_message?id=22894)
- Be warned that the braille viewer sometimes isn't perfectly in sync with JAWS' audio output
    - In general, the braille viewer is more accurate though (TODO: we should provide some more explanations here!)

# Speech History

- Sometimes it's interesting to see what JAWS announced in the past (or to copy&paste some output)
- To open the output history, press `JAWS + Space`, then `H`
- The history shows that last 20 announcements
- Sadly, the history doesn't refresh automatically
