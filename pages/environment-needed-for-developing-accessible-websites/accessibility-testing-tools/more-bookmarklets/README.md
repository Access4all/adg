# More Bookmarklets

And even some more bookmarklets, such as the HTML_CodeSniffer.

# HTML_CodeSniffer

  - Go to [HTML_CodeSniffer](http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/) and get the bookmarklet there
  - HTML_CodeSniffer is a client-side script that checks HTML source code and detects violations of a defined coding standard.

# Revenge.css

  - Go to [Revenge.css](http://heydonworks.com/revenge_css_bookmarklet/) and get the bookmarklet there
  - Revenge.css is a CSS bookmarklet that reports bad html using pseudo content. If the page you use it with has malformed links, deprecated attributes, <div>s inside inline elements, inaccessible buttons, badly nested sections or other errors, you'll see some ugly, pink errors written in nobody's favourite font: Comic Sans
