We deliver a copy of a [modern.ie Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/), enriched with free to use software and proper configuration.

The modern.IE VM comes with a license that allows free usage during 90 days. After launching the VM the first time, Windows will ask for activation. **Note:** if you create a snapshot before activation, you can rollback again and use the VM basically without any limit.
