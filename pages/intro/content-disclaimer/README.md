# Content Disclaimer

**TODO**

Or: **"Why you shouldn't believe us everything we claim in this guide"**

## Remember browser wars?

  You remember **[browser wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars)**, don't you? Different devices and technologies battled for supremacy on the [WWW](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), and it was extremely hard (if not impossible) to create a website that was capable of being displayed correctly on every browser.

  In some way, **the same applies to accessibility a little bit today** - not because of opposing forces fighting each other, but because **it's a very broad and long time neglected topic**. At the time being, there are now black/white answers to many questions, and there's not a solution to every specific problem. There are standards, and technology vendors all in all are acting in concert, but it will take some time, until the whole topic has gained a mature status in both technical aspects and in public awareness.

## What does this mean?

  The good message: **there are many good solutions to most problems**, and **pitfalls are well known** and thus can be circumvented. At [«Access for all»](http://www.access-for-all.ch), we have many years of experience in distinguishing good practices from problematic ones, and in recommending them to our clients.

  Still, **we are not all-knowing** - the web is evolving every day, and we're trying to keep up with it. So in this guide, **we are only providing our own opinions and best practices here**. We don't claim them to be the best ones (let be the only ones), but they are based on our profound experience as both users and developers of websites and built upon knowledge of the official resources like [WCAG 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines).

## Never forget!

  Please **keep this in mind while reading this guide**. If you stumble over something that seems inadequate or even wrong, you are very welcome to **#{link_to 'support us', page_path('support_us')}** with corrections, suggestions, or even plain hard code!
