# Contribute to this guide

**This guide is the result of tight collaboration between accessibility experts and web developers. Its content by far is not exhaustive yet: there remain a lot of topics to talk about, and due to the fast evolution of web technologies, there certainly will always be.**

We welcome everyone who wants to join our initiative, be it with adding new contents, fixing typos or bugs, etc.

Let us make the Internet a more accessible place together!
