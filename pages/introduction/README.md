# Introduction to our guide

**The «Accessibility Developer Guide» is an initiative of «Access for all», Swiss Foundation for technology adapted to people with disabilities. It is developed and maintained in collaboration with a number of acclaimed web agencies. The vision behind the Accessibility Developer Guide is to bridge the gap between providers of websites and users with special needs.**

## How to go through this part

This part gives you a broad picture of how to use the Accessibility Developer Guide either as a comprehensive tutorial for learning accessibility, as well as a quick reference for your daily development business. As the guide is Open Source, we welcome contributions from the community, and here we explain how to accomplish that.

This part also provides information about the so-called «Accessibility Alliance», consisting of the people and organisations behind this initiative, and how to contact and join them.
