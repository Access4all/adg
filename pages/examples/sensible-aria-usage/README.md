# Sensible usage of ARIA roles and attributes

**There are some ARIA roles and attributes that we use and recommend in our daily business, especially regarding JavaScript widgets. They are well supported by screen readers, and if you know their peculiarities, they can be very helpful in creating accessible websites. However, we often describe and recommend alternative techniques with traditional HTML.**

Before you proceed, please thoroughly read [ARIA - when HTML simply is not enough](/knowledge/aria) and [Introduction to screen reader usage](/knowledge/screen-readers), especially [Screen readers' browse and focus modes](/knowledge/screen-readers/desktop/browse-focus-modes)!
