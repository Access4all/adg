# Tablist widgets (or: tab panels, tabs)

**Tablists help to split up a page's content into smaller and thus more digestible parts. Each part is minimally represented in a list of names, by which their visibility can be enabled one at a time. Tablists can be thought of as small page fragments inside a page.**

[[_TOC_]]

Tablists are well known as native controls in many operating systems: a list of controls (usually on top of the element) allows to toggle the visibility of corresponding panels. Only a single control can be active at a time, so exactly one panel is visible and all others are hidden.

We do not call tablists simply "tabs" so the difference to the `Tab` key is obvious.

## General requirements

The following requirements are based on well established best practices and [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices: Tab Panel Widget](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel).

Besides many other requirements, we want to stress out explicitly the following:

- The meaning and usage of the tablist must be clear.
- The state of each tab control must be perceivable ("active/inactive" or similar).
- Proper feedback must be given upon activating a tab control ("active" or similar).
- The tablist must be operable using both keyboard only and screen readers (with a reasonable interplay of default keys like `Tab`, `Enter`/`Space`, `Esc`, `Arrow` keys), as well as mobile screen readers.
- The panel contents must be easily accessible using both keyboard only and screen reader.

### Similarities with accordions and carousels

Maybe you never noticed that tablists, carousels, and accordions - although looking pretty distinct from each other - all solve a very similar use case: toggling the visibility of contents.

Tablists are the most basic pattern of them all. Carousels then extend it by providing additional controls like previous/next and autoplay/pause button(s). And accordions extend it by stacking all controls and panels on top of each other; in addition, some of them allow to display multiple panels at the same time.

Because of this, the following texts apply not only to tablists, but also to carousels (see [Carousels (or: slideshow, slider)](/examples/widgets/carousel)) and accordions (see [Accordions](/examples/widgets/accordion)).

## Proofs of concept

Before you go on, please read [What is a "Proof of concept"?](/examples/widgets/proof-of-concept) (POC).

ARIA is supported pretty well for tablists (see POC #1). If you need a much simpler solution though, and according to our credo [Widgets simply working for all](/knowledge/semantics/widgets), the easiest way to create a tablist is using a simple group of radio buttons (see POC #2).

### POC #2: Radio buttons

They can be styled visually as needed using CSS, and spiced up with (very little) JavaScript, so they behave like perfect tablists.

Sensible naming of elements (and a few specifically added visually hidden texts) guarantees that screen reader users know how to handle the element - even if they have not seen any other tablist before.

#### Implementation details

Some interesting peculiarities:

- Elements are announced properly by screen readers, and it is clearly perceivable which control is active: the one with the active radio button.
- Proper feedback is given upon interaction: whenever a control is activated, the screen reader announces the respective radio button's state.
- Collapsed panels are hidden effectively from everybody, see [Hiding elements from all devices](/examples/hiding-elements/from-all-devices).
- Where functionality may not be obvious to screen reader users, descriptive text is given (only visible to screen readers):
    - The tablist/carousel/accordion's main heading has "tablist/carousel/accordion" appended.
    - A small help text explains how the tablist/carousel/accordion works.
    - The controls are named "tablist/carousel/accordion controls" and are placed within a `fieldset`/`legend` structure (see [Grouping form controls with fieldset and legend](/examples/forms/grouping-with-fieldset-legend)).
    - Each control is named "Show panel X".
    - Each panel's heading has "panel" appended.
- The tablist/carousel/accordion controls are placed in the DOM before the panels:
    - As the whole element is properly marked up with headings, screen reader users can jump very quickly between controls and panels (see [How to handle headings](/examples/headings/handling)).
- Using `.tablist:focus-within .control label`, a style can be applied to all radio button labels upon interacting with the tablist.
    - This gives users a clue that they are interacting with a single control now (indicating to use the `Arrow` keys instead of `Tab` to navigate through tab items).
    - If you would rather like to make each control focusable on its own, you could use a group of checkboxes instead of radio buttons.
          - Do not forget to make sure only one of them is checked at a time though (using some JavaScript).
