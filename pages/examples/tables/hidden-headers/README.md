# Visually hidden table headers

Simply add the table headers, then hide them visually (if you haven't done this yet, go back and read [Hiding elements visually by moving them off-screen](/examples/hiding-elements/visually){.page}).

@example[Table with hidden headers](table-with-hidden-headers){.example}

This works for both horizontal and vertical table headers.
