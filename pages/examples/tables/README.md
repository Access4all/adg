# Data tables

**Tables allow to present complex data in a structured manner. They have a long history: from layout tables around the 2000's to today's need for responsive tables. Traditional tables are fully accessible, but you still should try to keep them as simple as possible. Even in more advanced use cases, they can be fully accessible - if you know how to do them right.**
