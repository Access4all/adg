# How to browse forms

# Keyboard-only usage

Nothing extraordinary to say here, just be sure to have thoroughly read [How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only](/knowledge/keyboard-only/browsing-websites){.page}!

# Screen reader usage

**Important:** The following is only a small refresher! Before you proceed, please be sure to have thoroughly read [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers){.page}!

## Quick navigation

- `Tab`: jump to next focusable element
- `F`: jump to next form element
- `B`: jump to next button
- `X`: jump to next checkbox
- `C`: jump to next combobox
- `R`: jump to next radio button

**Note:** You can add `Shift` to most shortcuts to reverse direction, e.g. press `Shift + Tab` to jump to the **previous** focusable element.

## Interaction with form elements

- `Enter` or `Esc`: enter or exit focus mode (when on editable form element)
    - A distinctive **beep** sound is audible
    - `Insert + Space` is an alternative way to toggle interaction modes (regardless where the cursor is at the moment)
- `Space`: toggle checkbox and expand/collapse combobox
- `Enter`: submit form (on certain form elements, when in focus mode)
- `Enter`: activate button
- `Up` / `Down` (and sometimes `Left` / `Right`)
    - Select radio button value
    - Select element in combobox

# Bookmarklets

- "Contents structured" bookmarklet
    - Highlights a lot of HTML elements (incl. form elements), conveying their tag names
    - Allows for fast visual detection of wrong (or missing) structures!
