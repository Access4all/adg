        A name typically consists of a first and a last name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people also have a middle name. Or more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of that, we offer a single input here, instead of one for each kind of name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some cultures even have habits of naming that are very different to ours, so it's really hard (if not impossible) to define a offer an input mask that's working for all. This is another reason why having a single input works fine here.
