# Hiding elements correctly

**There are cases when some element on a page needs to be hidden in some way: for example you want to show some content to one audience, but not to another one. In this chapter, you learn how to do this properly. Much is possible, but there are some pitfalls you really need to know about.**

We show how to hide elements from specific channels:

- [How to hide elements visually](/examples/hiding-elements/visually){title="Hiding elements visually by moving them off-screen"} by moving them off-screen, a dirty old workaround.
- [How to hide elements from screen readers](/examples/hiding-elements/from-screen-readers){title="Hiding elements from screen readers using aria-hidden"} using ARIA - and in what situations this can lead to problems.
- [How to hide elements from all devices](/examples/hiding-elements/from-all-devices){title="Hiding elements from all devices"} using HTML or CSS.

Then we take a short look at some regularly asked questions about possible [search engine optimisation problems](/examples/hiding-elements/okay-for-seo){title="Regarding search engine optimisation, is it okay to hide elements?"} regarding hidden elements.
