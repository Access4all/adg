# Hiding elements from all devices

**To hide an element from all devices means just that: no single device will perceive it anymore (although the element still is present in the DOM). This can be achieved using either an HTML attribute or CSS attributes.**

[[_TOC_]]

Elements can be hidden completely from all devices (including screen readers).

## Using hidden attribute

In HTML 5, the `hidden` attribute was introduced. It can be set on an element directly and makes it completely invisible to any device.

## Using CSS properties

Setting `display: none` to an element has the same effect like the `hidden` attribute:

The same applies for `visibility: hidden`:

## Which one to use?

We strongly suggest using the HTML attribute `hidden`, as it separates content clearly from presentation. Notice: hiding an element from all channels is a question of content, not of visual presentation.

In addition, it makes obvious in the DOM already what elements are hidden, so it leads to better readable and maintainable code.

## Note about ARIA references

Elements hidden with the techniques shown on this page can still provide content when being referenced using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`. More information here: [Labelling elements using aria-label and aria-labelledby](/examples/sensible-aria-usage/label-labelledby).
