# Determine Running Assistive Technology

**TODO**

Sometimes it's good to know what assistive devices a user has. This isn't possible in a programatic way, though, but you still have the possibility to just ask.

## Determine Screen Reader Usage

Only possibility: ask! Display a visibly hidden option at the beginning of the page, e.g. a non-focusable link or checkbox. Upon activation, the page can reload and e.g. display easier/accessible form controls.

## Determine Keyboard-Only

Possible in a reasonable way?
