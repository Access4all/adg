# General headings example

The following example contains a very basic headings outline - it may look familiar to you from "normal" print documents (e.g. Word or PDF) and books.

Structuring content with headings is always a good thing: no published book containing text content could ever live without it! Headings allow to skim through the book, and the table of contents of a book is based on them.

On a visual level, the headings' prominent visual attributes (e.g. font size, weight, sometimes colours, etc.) allow visual users to know when a new chapter or sub chapter starts or ends, or to skim through the pages of a book looking for a specific chapter.

On a semantical level, headings also announce to screen users when a new chapter or sub chapter starts or ends, and it allows them to jump from one headings to another quickly. By displaying the full headings outline in the form of a table of contents, the screen reader users can get an idea about the page's content very quickly.
