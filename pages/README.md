# Welcome to the Accessibility Developer Guide!

**If you want to learn more about designing and implementing fully accessible websites, you've come to the right place.**

All our contents are based strictly on the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)). Our goal is to provide you with the simplest and most effective best practices on how to design, implement and test websites with accessibility in mind.
