# Desktop screen readers

**Desktop screen readers are rather complex to understand and control, as they offer many features and ways to interact with websites. Compared to mobile screen readers, they deliver a both broader and more detailed picture on the robustness of a website, revealing most potential accessibility issues. As such, they are indispensable testing tools.**

There are various screen readers available on all major desktop operating systems, but only two of them are relevant for testing accessibility: NVDA and JAWS (both running on Windows). The following section assumes that they are installed and configured properly. So if you haven't done this yet, go back and read:

- [Relevant combinations of screen readers and browsers](/knowledge/screen-readers/relevant-combinations/)
- [NVDA installation and configuration](/setup/screen-readers/nvda/)
- [JAWS installation and configuration](/setup/screen-readers/jaws/)
