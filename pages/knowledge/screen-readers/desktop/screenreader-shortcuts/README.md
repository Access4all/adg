# Desktop screen reader keyboard shortcuts

**While desktop screen readers literally have dozens (if not hundreds) of keyboard shortcuts, only a fraction of them is needed for everyday usage. The following cheat-sheet lists the most important ones.**

We keep this page short and sweet. Throughout this guide, there is much more information available about the tackled subjects.

And remember: when talking about the `NVDA` or `JAWS` keys, we mean the `Insert` key.

## Navigation

- `Ctrl + Home` announces the current page title and moves the cursor to the top of the page.
- `Down`/`Up` announces the next/previous line of text in the current element.
    - If the end (or start) of the element is reached, the cursor is moved to the next (or previous) one.
- In NVDA, pressing `Ctrl + Down` (or `Ctrl + Up`) moves to the next (or previous) element, announcing it fully in one go (regardless of its length).
- `Tab` moves to the next focusable element (e.g. link or button), triggering focus mode if appropriate.
- `H`/`Shift + H` moves to the next/previous heading.
- `1`/`Shift + 1` to `6`/`Shift + 6` moves to the next/previous heading of that level.
- `K`/`Shift + K` moves to the next/previous link.
- `T`/`Shift + T` moves to the next/previous table.
- `Control + Alt + Arrow keys` moves the cursor around a table's cells.
- `L`/`Shift + L` moves to the next/previous list.
- `I`/`Shift + I` moves to the next/previous list item.
- `F`/`Shift + F` moves to the next/previous form control.
- `B`/`Shift + B` moves to the next/previous button.

## Interaction

- `Enter` activates an element (e.g. link or button).
     - When on a form field, focus mode is activated.
     - When on an ARIA widget, application mode is activated.
- `Esc` exits focus mode (if active).

## Audio output

- `Control` interrupts the screen reader output.
- `Shift` skips the current line of the screen reader output.

## NVDA

- `NVDA + N` shows the NVDA menu.
- `NVDA + F7` shows the elements list (with links, headings, landmarks, etc.).
- `NVDA + Space` toggles between browse mode and focus mode.
- `NVDA + S` toggles between speech modes (talk/beep/off).

## JAWS

- `JAWS + J` shows the JAWS menu.
- `JAWS + F6` displays the heading list.
- `JAWS + F3` shows the elements list (with links, headings, landmarks, etc.).
