# Contrast requirements of text content

**TODO**

There is a distinction between default text and large text.

## Large text

Large text is defined as:

- Either at least 14 point **bold** text, like `font-size: 14pt` combined with `font-weight: bold`.
- Or at least 18 point regular text, like `font-size: 18pt`.

To offer enough contrast, large text needs a ratio of at least `3:1`.

## Default text

All other text simply is default text. As per definition it is smaller than large text, it is considered harder to read, needing a higher contrast ratio of at least `4.5:1`.
