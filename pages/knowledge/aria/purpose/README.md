# The purpose behind the WAI-ARIA standard

**When it comes to requirements of modern interactive websites, sometimes the semantic vocabulary of HTML may not be enough anymore. To fill this gap, the Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) specification was introduced: it describes how to add semantics to HTML content in order to make user controls and dynamic content more accessible. However, there are pitfalls you need to know about.**

## Handling HTML shortcomings

Over the last 10 to 20 years, not much has changed to the way content is laid out and marked up in HTML. But since its early days, many de-facto standard user interface patterns have made their way into the collective awareness of the internet, often generally referred to as widgets or rich internet applications (RIAs). Many of those lack native HTML equivalents, typical examples being tablists, dropdown menus, and autocompletes.

### Fictional tablist example

Take a look at the following fictional code:

```html
<!-- Fictional example! Will not work in real life. -->
<tablist>
  <tabitem target="dancing">Dancing</tabitem>
  <tabitem target="soccer">Soccer</tabitem>

  <tabpanel id="dancing">...</tabpanel>
  <tabpanel id="soccer">...</tabpanel>
</tablist>
```

It would be great to have something like this natively in HTML, where the browser would provide all behaviour of toggling visibility of elements when activating a tabitem. But this didn't happen yet, and maybe never will.

### Mimicking a tablist visually

Visually, it isn't a problem to mimic a tablist. Just use some appropriate standard HTML, then apply some visual attributes and custom JavaScript behaviour to resemble a tablist's look and feel:

```css
.tablist {
  /* Some nice visual attributes */
}
```

```javascript
$(".tablist [data-target]").click(function() {
  // Some fancy JavaScript to toggle tabpanel visibility
});
```

```html
<div class="tablist">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <button data-target="#dancing" class="active">Dancing</button>
    </li>

    <li>
      <button data-target="#soccer">Soccer</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div id="dancing">...</div>
  <div id="soccer" hidden>...</div>
</div>
```

But simply presenting something visually isn't enough for screen readers (if you are really curious and want to learn more about this, skip ahead and read [Screen readers don't convey visual attributes](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/no-visual-attributes){.page}). For example, although the currently active tabitem can be distinguished visually using `class="active"` and some CSS styling, screen readers won't know which tabitem in fact is the active one. Proper semantical information is missing.

## ARIA to the rescue (?)

To fill this gap, the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) - which belongs to the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3)](https://www.w3.org/) - has introduced the [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) technical specification. It provides specific HTML attributes (`role` and `aria-*`) that allow adding specific semantical meaning to existing HTML elements:

- `role` attributes add (or override) a semantical role of an element, for example `<span role="button">`.
- `aria-*` attributes provide statuses to the current semantical role, for example `<span role="button" aria-pressed="true">`.
    - Those statuses can have specific values, depending on the role of the element.

Many de-facto standard user interface patterns do have an ARIA specification, and so do tablists, see [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 - Tablist](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tablist).

### Tablist using ARIA

Marked up with ARIA, our tablist example would look something like this:

```html
<div class="tablist">
  <ul role="tablist">
    <li role="presentation">
      <button role="tab" aria-controls="dancing" aria-selected="true">Dancing</button>
    </li>

    <li role="presentation">
      <button role="tab" aria-controls="soccer" aria-selected="false">Soccer</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div role="tabpanel" id="dancing">...</div>
  <div role="tabpanel" id="soccer" hidden>...</div>
</div>
```

First, `role="tablist"` was added to the list container (containing the tabs). The `<ul>` element won't be announced as list now anymore by screen readers, but as something like "tablist" (depending on the screen reader).

Then, `role="presentation"` was added to the list elements of the former list. As the list isn't a list anymore, the specific `<li>` elements must not have specific list semantics anymore. The `presentation` role removes any semantical information: the `<li>` elements are now treated similar to plain `<div>` elements. It may seem silly to use a semantic container and then remove its semantics. But this is generally a good practice for providing backwards compatibility with legacy screen readers that may not support ARIA.

Finally, `role="tab"` was added to each tab element. The `<button>` element won't be announced as button now anymore by screen readers, but as something like "tab" (depending on the screen reader). In addition, some special `aria-*` attributes were added:

- `aria-controls` lets screen readers know, which tabpanel's visibility is toggled upon activation or deactivation of the tab. This allows to quickly jump from tabitem to tabpanel forth and back (depending on the screen reader).
- `aria-selected` lets screen readers know, which tab is currently the active one, and announces this to the user with something like "active" (depending on the screen reader).

Nice and clean. This looks pretty promising, doesn't it?

### A magic all-in-one solution? No.

Are you in hope of ARIA "magically" solving all the problems with missing semantics?

Don't be too optimistic: ARIA is a bare set of attributes and their specific values. So in contrast to traditional HTML, the browser doesn't take care of anything itself. You still have to provide all the interactivity yourself using JavaScript! In the current example, you need to:

- Implement an intuitive keyboard control pattern (or provide clear instruction of how to control the widget with keyboard only and screen readers).
- Take care of toggling the visibility of the tabpanels.
- Take care of toggling `aria-selected`.

Admitted, a tablist is a rather easy user interface pattern, so it's not too hard to provide this functionality yourself. But there are much more complex patterns (for example, autocompletes), where it can become a major challenge managing all the required attributes and keeping their states and visual representation in sync.

### Non-homogenous support

To make things even trickier, ARIA support among browsers and screen readers varies a lot. And both browsers and screen readers are prone to being buggy. This is particularly true regarding ARIA support: as soon as the `role` attribute is used, unexpected things may happen. If you are really curious and want to learn more about this, skip ahead and read [How screen readers work - and why they seem so buggy](/knowledge/desktop-screen-readers/so-buggy){.page}.

As such, there are extremely few truly working examples of ARIA widgets available on the web. And those few ones usually need a lot of complex code to work around known problems.

## Conclusion

The intention behind ARIA is intriguing: it could be a big help in making the web a more accessible place. And knowing that ARIA was released in 2014, it is a real shame that browsers and screen readers still by far aren't capable of truly handling it. Alas, even if developers use ARIA in perfect accordance to its technical specification, this will not be of much use for the targeted users. So at the time being, in most cases we don't recommend the use of ARIA. Let us hope that the situation will soon change for the better.

Aside from the `role` attribute (which you should try to avoid in most cases), there exist `aria-*` attributes that can be used standalone and are supported by all modern browsers and screen readers. In a few specific situations, these attributes can be of real help, but you need to know exactly in which cases (please read on).

And regarding widgets: instead of using complex ARIA semantics and developing all interactivity on one's own, once again, the usage of traditional HTML helps in creating even complex interactive usage patterns. So if you haven't done this yet, go back and read [Widgets simply working for all](/knowledge/semantics/widgets){.page}.
