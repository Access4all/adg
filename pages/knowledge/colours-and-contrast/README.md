# Colours and contrast

**Accessibility goes far beyond functionality and code. When it comes to visual appearances, colours require special consideration. The meaning of a certain colour as well as the contrast between multiple colours directly affect how well a person can perceive and understand what is on screen. Colour palettes should therefore be composed carefully and according to some basic rules.**
