# Why Accessible ICT Are Important



Why should you go the extra mile for an accessible website - besides the fact that **15% of the world population** ([World report on disability](http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/), Table 2.2, p. 30, [June, 1, 2017]) are affected by some sort of disability? 

## Some ideas to think about

- **Your commitment:** To people with disabilities and special needs, modern ICT offer great opportunities to keep oneself informed and to communicate with the environment in unforeseen ways. To date ICT is maybe more important to people with disabilities than to anybody else. *This bears the chance to boost self-determination, autonomy and real and sustainable inclusion of people with disabilities. Be it social, cultural, educational inclusion and even inclusive job markets.*
- **Legal requirements:** Many countries and supranational organizations know laws and policies addressing ICT-Accessibility. Among which there is Switzerland ([P028 - Richtlinien des Bundes für die Gestaltung von barrierefreien Internetangeboten](https://www.isb.admin.ch/isb/de/home/ikt-vorgaben/prozesse-methoden/p028-richtlinien_bund_gestaltung_barrierefreie_internetangebote.html), [eCH-0059 Accessibility Standard](https://www.ech.ch/vechweb/page?p=dossier&documentNumber=eCH-0059), see also [EDI EBGB Rechtliche Grundlagen](https://www.edi.admin.ch/edi/de/home/fachstellen/ebgb/themen-der-gleichstellung/kommunikation/rechtliche-grundlagen.html)), Germany ([Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung - BITV 2.0](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/BJNR184300011.html)), France ([Référentiel Général d’Accessibilité des Administrations (RGAA)](https://references.modernisation.gouv.fr/rgaa-accessibilite/)) and the USA (Section 508 on [www.section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/), About the Section 508 Standards on [www.access-board.gov](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards)) or the European Union ([Web and Mobile Accessibility Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.327.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:327:TOC)) and the United Nations ([UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)). Find further countries and their policies on W3C ([Web Accessibility Laws and Policies on W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/)).
- **Economic benefit:** By offering your products and services in an accessible, simple and easy way you *increase your customer base* by up to 15%. Given the ongoing demographic shift towards more elderly people, this estimation may increase in the near future in western societies.
- **Clean code:** Accessibility heavily relies on *clean HTML code*. Websites built with accessibility in mind generally result in a high quality, easily maintainable products. 

Create accessible websites, starting from the current day! It's not that hard, you'll see!
