# Background: Understanding ICT Accessibility

# What you will get

You'll learn in a very pragmatic way many important things you need to know when creating accessible websites. We'll provide you with both **background information** and **concrete, sensible code examples** that you can experiment with so you get a profound feeling about what's needed to make a website accessible.

A big part is **focused on [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) usage**, as it covers most of the important topics. But other relevant tools and assistive technologies are discussed, too.

This guide is written in a **rather shorthand and technical language**, so good knowledge of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and commonly used browser technologies is assumed.

# How to use this guide

## Preparation

To develop accessible websites, some specific tools are needed.

In this section, we'll introduce you to the main tool we use in our daily business, the screenreader, and how it can be configured for optimum performance when developing and testing websites on accessibility.

## Examples

To develop good websites, one first has to know, what differs a normal website from an accessible website.

You'll notice that there's not so much difference, and most of it lies in the cleanliness of everyday HTML code - accessibility is no sorcery! Sure, there are more sophisticated topics (e.g. the use of [WAI-ARIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA)), and we'll cover them too.

## Widgets

A common pitfall when creating websites is choosing inaccessible 3rd party widgets for custom controls like tab panels, fancy form elements, etc.

Oftentimes, such widgets that offer fancy features for "normal" users are hard or even impossible to use for disabled users, and it's usually not easy to make them accessible and thus can ruin the whole user experience. In this section we are telling you what to keep in mind when choosing a widget. We also offer reviews about widgets we know.

## Recipes

Much of the "magic" about developing accessible websites (and testing them) boils down to not much more than a handful of tools and a few specific workflows associated to each of them.

Here you'll get specific instructions on how to inspect the most common accessibility problems, and how you can elaborate solutions for them.

## Appendix

There are some ever-repeating questions in accessibility, and they are worth to be discussed in more detail.

Here you find a collection of interesting articles about various topics.

# Full read vs. reading parts

While you can read this guide from beginning to end, we tried to make the different sections as self-standing as possible.

You are free to read every page on its own, but we encourage to read the full guide thoroughly.

## How to navigate?

Please use the menu on top of this page to navigate through the different sections. Every menu group has an overview page, which you should read first. Be sure not to miss any sub pages: they are displayed below each page, if there are any.

The easiest way is to use the "Browsing" feature that allows you to browse the full website page by page like a book.
