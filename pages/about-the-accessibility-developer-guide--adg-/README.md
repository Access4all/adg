I'm working as a web developer (frontend and backend) since more than 10 years. My motto has always been: **"Good code - is clean code - is less code - is maintainable code - is accessible code.**"

I'm working for «Access for all» for nearly 3 years now, and being the first qualified web developer in the team, I'm heavily pushing our services for other web developers, be it creating this guide, holding workshops for developers or conducting in-house consulting for clients.
