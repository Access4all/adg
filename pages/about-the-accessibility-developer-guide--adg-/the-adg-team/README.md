I'm working as a full stack web developer (frontend and backend) for more than 10 years. My motto has always been:

> **Good code** is **clean** code is **less** code is **maintainable** code is **accessible** code.

I'm working for «Access for all» since 2014, and being the first qualified web developer in the team, I'm heavily pushing our services for other web developers, as **it's absolutely crucial that disabled people and the web industry are working together tightly**. This makes it possible that modern digital media is highly usable for both disabled an non-disabled people. And that's the reason why I started the present project: so **I'm the spiritual father of the «Accessibility Developer Guide»**.

Besides this, I'm holding public and in-house [workshops for developers](http://www.access-for-all.ch/ch/schulung/kurse-und-seminare.html), auditing websites and mobile apps on accessibility and conducting consulting about all topics accessibility.

I'm working as an accessibility consultant for «Access for all» since it was founded 15 years ago.

I suffer from [hemiplegia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spastic_hemiplegia) since birth and I'm visually impaired as well. I control my computer using a standard keyboard with one hand a braille display. **I'm using screenreaders and other assistive technologies on a daily basis** and can offer a lot of experience in this area. As part of my job I do thorough website and mobile app testing including analysis of code.
