# Firefox installation and configuration

![Firefox logo](_media/firefox-logo.png){.image}

# Installation

The Quantum release of FF isn't compatible with screen readers yet: [Can I use my screen reader with the new Firefox? (Mozilla.org)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/can-i-use-my-screen-reader-new-firefox).

At the time being, you should [download the Extended Support Release (ESR) of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/) and install it.

Note: there's also a [portable version](https://portableapps.com/de/apps/internet/firefox_portable) of FF that doesn't require admin rights.

# Configuration

## Displaying all toolbars

Make sure that in the menu, under `View > Toolbars`, all items are selected.

If you don't see the menu, press the `Alt` key once.

## Restoring tabs after restart

You may open and close browsers repeatedly during accessibility testing. To see how to configure FF to restore tabs upon restart, see [Restore previous session - Configure when Firefox shows your most recent tabs and windows (Mozilla.org)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-previous-session).
