# Microsoft Edge installation and configuration

**Edge replaces Microsoft's legacy browser Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) and is based on the same [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) open-source code base as Google Chrome.**

## Installation

[Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) is the default browser on new Windows versions. However, it is available for other platforms like macOS and Linux, too.

## Configuration

### Restoring tabs after restart

You may open and close browsers repeatedly during accessibility testing. To learn how to configure Edge to restore tabs upon restart, see [How to reopen closed tabs in Microsoft Edge â€“ Restore a previous session (microsoft.com)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/how-to-reopen-closed-tabs).

## Add-ons

We recommend adding selected [browser extensions](/setup/helper-tools/browser-extensions/) and [bookmarklets](/setup/helper-tools/bookmarklets/) to your browser.

## IE 11

The installation and setup instructions for IE 11 are [still available here](../internet-explorer-11/).
