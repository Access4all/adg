# Microsoft Edge installation and configuration

**Edge replaces Microsoft's legacy browser Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) and is based on the same [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) open-source code base as Google Chrome.**

## Installation

[Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) is the default browser on new Windows versions. However, it is available for other platforms like macOS and Linux, too.

## Configuration

### Add-Ons

Most Chrome extensions [should be installable](https://www.howtogeek.com/411830/how-to-install-google-chrome-extensions-in-microsoft-edge/) in Edge, too. Extensions like [axe](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/axe-web-accessibility-t/kcenlimkmjjkdfcaleembgmldmnnlfkn) are additionally distributed directly via Microsoft's [Edge Add-ons page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home).

## IE 11

The installation and setup instructions for IE 11 are [still available here](../internet-explorer-11/).
