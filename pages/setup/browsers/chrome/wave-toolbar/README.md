## Installation

[Download WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) and install it.

### Online service

Instead of installing it, you can use WAVE's online service on [wave.webaim.org](http://wave.webaim.org/).

## Usage

Activate WAVE by clicking its symbol in the browser toolbar.

The most interesting items are the red (errors) and yellow (alerts) ones.

### Discretion advised

In general, be careful with the displayed results. Automated test tools are very limited and tend to display both false-positive as well as false-negative results.
