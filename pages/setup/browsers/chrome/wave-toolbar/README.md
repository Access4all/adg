# WAVE toolbar

**WAVE toolbar gives you a very quick first impression about the quality of the current webpage's accessibility. At the press of a button, it provides visual cues by injecting icons and detailed information right into the page.**

The most interesting items are the red (error) and yellow (alert) ones.

### Discretion advised

In general, be careful with the displayed results. Automated test tools are very limited and tend to display both false-positive as well as false-negative results.
