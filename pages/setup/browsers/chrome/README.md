## Installation

[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) and install it.

## Configuration

### Restoring tabs after restart

You may open and close browsers repeatedly during accessibility testing. To learn how to configure Chrome to restore tabs upon restart, see [Set your homepage and startup page â€“ Continue where you left off (google.com)](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95314#zippy=%2Ccontinue-where-you-left-off).

## Add-ons

We recommend adding selected [browser extensions](/setup/helper-tools/browser-extensions/) and [bookmarklets](/setup/helper-tools/bookmarklets/) to your browser.
