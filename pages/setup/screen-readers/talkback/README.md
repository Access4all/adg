# Talkback configuration

**Talkback is the mobile screen reader of Android. It is pre-installed on Android devices, easy to understand, and the most used mobile screen reader in non-Western countries.**  
On some older Android versions, the TalkBack service is not enabled by default.  In this case, just install or update the "Android Accessibility Suite" collection from the Google Play Store.  
We find the default settings to be sensible and a good starting point but if you want to explore further,
extensive information about the TalkBack setup options can be found at the [official TalkBack setup page](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283655)

## Android Accessibility configuration
Android comes equipped with a number of accessibility features which can be usually configured under the "Settings, Accessibility" menu. 

### Accessibility shortcut
This setting allows the user the quickly activate the android accessibility features, including TalkBack.  
On newer Android versions, the shortcut is operated by pressing both volume keys for 3 seconds.  
On older Android versions this was a 2-step procedure, requiring you to first press the power button and then press both volume keys for 5 seconds.  
We've found that, in practice, no matter the Android version, the shortcut may or may not work, depending on the device brand and further user interface customisations done by the vendor.
 

### Display Speech Output
Displays the current announcement as text on screen. Very useful while developing! Sadly there's nothing like that in VoiceOver/iOS.

### Colour inversion
Changes the display to a bright foreground content on a dark background.  Useful also to improve readability when using the device at night.  
Just be aware that some issues may be encountered when used together with Android's Dark theme.
