# Browser extensions

**Browser extensions are software modules for customizing and extending a web browser. Browsers typically allow users to install a variety of extensions, including those that make development and testing easier.**

We recommend that you add all of the extensions suggested below to each and every of your browsers (you never know when you might need them).

Note: Most Chrome extensions can also [be used with Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/add-turn-off-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-9c0ec68c-2fbc-2f2c-9ff0-bdc76f46b026#ID0EDL).
