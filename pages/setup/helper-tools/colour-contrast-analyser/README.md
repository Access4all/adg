lead: "It is the job of frontend designers to choose contrasty foreground and background colours. To double check this while implementing the design, it is always good to have the right tool at hand. The Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) helps to determine the legibility of text and other visual elements by ensuring high contrast with the background."
