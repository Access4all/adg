# Total Validator

**Total Validator checks your website regarding various web and accessibility standards by the press of a button. Building valid code is one of the highest goals developers should strive for. Total Validator helps a lot with achieving this.**

**Note:** According to the W3C as of September 2023, the success criterion 4.1.1 (“Parsing”) is considered as always satisfied for any system using HTML or XML, and there is no need to test it anymore (see [w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html){ target=_blank }).<br><br><br>

## Installation

[Download Total Validator](https://www.totalvalidator.com/downloads/){ target=_blank } and run the installer. Then install [Chrome, Firefox or Edge extensions](https://www.totalvalidator.com/downloads/extension.html){ target=_blank }.

## Configuration

Under `Validations`, we recommend to disable `Check for broken links`, as it slows the tool down.

## Usage
