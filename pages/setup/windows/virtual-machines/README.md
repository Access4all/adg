# Getting a free Windows virtual machine from Microsoft

**Microsoft offers free Windows virtual machine images for development. This is the easiest way to get your needed Windows environment up and running quickly for testing purposes.**

The available virtual machines can be [downloaded on Microsoft's website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/). We describe the setup with [VMWare on macOS](/setup/windows/vmware-on-macos/), [Windows and Linux](/setup/windows/vmware-on-windows-linux/), but you can use whatever VM platform you are familiar with.

The VMs are meant to be used for testing purposes only and expire after some time.

Be sure to change the VM's keyboard layout to your preferred one as described here: [How to change your keyboard layout (Windows Support)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/258824/how-to-change-your-keyboard-layout).
