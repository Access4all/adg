# Getting a free Windows virtual machine from Microsoft

**Microsoft offers free Windows virtual machine images for testing Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. While their licenses expire after 90 days of use, by creating a snapshot before activation, they can easily be reset again. This is the easiest way to get your needed Windows environment up and running quickly for testing purposes.**

## Download

The available virtual machines can be [downloaded on Microsoft's website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/). Get the **"MSEdge on Windows 10"** virtual machine for your desired VM platform. We describe the setup with [VMWare on macOs](/setup/windows/vmware-on-macos/), [Windows and Linux](/setup/windows/vmware-on-windows-linux/), but you can use whatever VM platform you are familiar with.

The VMs are meant to be used for testing purposes only.

## Default user and password

The VMs provided by Microsoft come with the following login credentials:

- User: `IEUser`
- Password: `Passw0rd!`

Note: VMs from Microsoft are set up with US-English keyboard layout. Therefore, the exclamation mark is triggered using `Shift + 1`.

If you want to change the password, see [Change your Windows password (Windows Support)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14087/windows-7-change-your-windows-password).

Be sure to change the VM's keyboard layout to your preferred one as described here: [How to change your keyboard layout (Windows Support)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/258824/how-to-change-your-keyboard-layout).
