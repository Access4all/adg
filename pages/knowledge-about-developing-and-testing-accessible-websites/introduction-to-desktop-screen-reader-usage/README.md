Here we discuss everything you need to know about using a screen reader to browse the web.

# TL;DR - Too long, didn't read

First things first: you need to know which (of the nearly endless number of) [combinations of browsers and screen readers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/relevant-screen-readers-and-browsers){.page title="Relevant screen readers and browsers"} are important to care about.

We begin by explaining that [screen readers are one-dimensional](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/screen-readers-are-one-dimensional){.page title="Screen readers are one-dimensional"} - meaning that they announce content and semantics in a linear way, while visual attributes aren't of interest!

This is followed by an introduction to [screen reader interaction modes](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/screen-reader-interaction-modes){.page title="Screen reader interaction modes"}, and why [screen reader keyboard shortcuts](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/screen-readers-are-keyboard-shortcut-monsters){.page title="Screen readers are keyboard shortcut monsters"} feel so nasty.

You then first learn [how to read websites using a screen reader](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/how-to-read-websites-using-a-desktop-screen-reader){.page title="How to read websites using a desktop screen reader"}, and then [how to interact with them](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/how-to-interact-with-websites-using-a-desktop-screen-reader){.page title="How to interact with websites using a desktop screen reader"}.

It's always fascinating to watch experts do something, so we provide you a [video of a "real" user browsing a website with a screen reader](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/video--how-a-real-user-browses-a-website-using-a-screen-reader){.page title="Video: How a real user browses a website using a screen reader"}.

While you certainly have to know your tools to create accessible websites, it's no witchcraft. Here we show off the [basic rules of implementing screen reader ready websites](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/how-to-implement-screen-reader-ready-websites){.page title="How to implement screen reader ready websites"}. And as they don't always behave the same, it's good to know about some [differences of screen readers](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/differences-between-jaws-and-nvda-screen-readers){.page title="Differences Between JAWS and NVDA Screen Readers"}.

Finally, we admit that they can be frustrating pieces of software - so here's our attempt of explaining [how screen readers work (and why they seem so buggy)](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/how-screen-readers-work---and-why-they-seem-so-buggy){.page title="How screen readers work - and why they seem so buggy"}. Followed right away with a list of well known [screen reader flaws](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage/screen-reader-flaws){.page title="Screen Reader Flaws"} and some points to remember about [why JAWS isn't a developer's best friend](@page-177).
