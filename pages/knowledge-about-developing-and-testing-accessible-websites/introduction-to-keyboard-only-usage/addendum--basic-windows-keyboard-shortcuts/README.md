# Addendum: Basic Windows keyboard shortcuts

If you know and use the following keyboard shortcuts by heart, you can officially call yourself a power user!

# System wide shortcuts

The following is a collection of some well known shortcuts (in no specific order).

- Press `Windows` to toggle Start menu
- Press `Alt + Tab` to switch between open windows
- Press `Alt` to focus current windows' application menu
- Press `Tab` to jump between focusable controls
- Press `Enter` to confirm something (e.g. closing a dialog and applying changes)
- Press `Space` to also confirm or interact with stuff (often used interchangeably with `Enter`)
- Press `Esc` to cancel something (e.g. closing a dialog without applying changes)

Note: By pressing `Alt`, the focus is placed in the current application's menu (if available). Using the arrow keys, you can then browse it. The focused item can be activated by pressing `Enter`.

# Application specific shortcuts

Most of the following shortcuts are pretty common to a wide set of similar applications:

- `Ctrl + S`: Save
- `Ctrl + O`: Open
- `Ctrl + T`: Open tab
- `Ctrl + W`: Close window (or tab)
- `Alt + F4`: Exit application
- `Ctrl + C`: Copy
- `Ctrl + V`: Paste
- `Ctrl + F`: Find

This list by far isn't complete, and each application may offer very distinct additional shortcuts.
