# How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only

Get a concrete idea of the main strategies available to read and interact with a website using keyboard only!

When browsing a website with keyboard only, the following keys typically are used.

Important: with "keyboard only" we mean that no screen reader is running! If a screen reader is running, website navigation behaves very different (see [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage){.page})!

# Opening a website

- By pressing `Ctrl + L` (or `F6`), the focus is placed in the web browser's address bar
- Now enter the domain as usual (e.g. `www.google.com`) and submit using `Enter`

# Reading a website

- To scroll the viewport down, use the `Down` arrow key
    - To move up, left or right (if available), use `Up` arrow key
- When tabbing through a page (see below), the viewport is scrolled automatically to the currently focused element, so using the arrow keys often isn't necessary

# Interacting with a website

- Use `Tab` key to move from focusable item to the next focusable item
    - This sometimes is called "Tabbing"
    - Focusable items typically are links, buttons, and form controls (text edit, combobox, etc.)
    - Add the `Shift` key to move to reverse direction
- Use `Enter` key to:
    - Activate a link or button
    - Send a form (when focusing a form item, e.g. a text edit)
- Use `Space` key to:
    - Toggle an element's state (e.g. checkbox)
    - Open or close an element (e.g. combobox)
- Use `Up` / `Down` / `Left` / `Right` arrow keys to:
    - Change the value of an item (e.g. a combobox or radio button group)
    - Move cursor (e.g. in a text edit)

# Now it's your turn!

Using the keyboard shortcuts above, you should be able to use any website to its fullest!
