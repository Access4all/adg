# Introduction to mobile screen reader usage



VoiceOver/iOS doesn't offer a table navigation (horizontal/vertical) like NVDA. You can jump from table to table (rotor), but not e.g. vertically from cell to cell. But additionally you can use the touch screen to navigate a table (if you know where the table is on the screen). VoiceOver/iOS announces table headers correctly (horizontally and vertically) => what about multiple header cells and colspan/rowspan?
