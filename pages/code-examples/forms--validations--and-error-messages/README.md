# Forms, validations, and error messages

Forms provide interactivity with websites. If coded properly, basic forms are natively accessible. And to achieve advanced functionalities, more sophisticated techniques are available.

When not simply reading websites, users are interacting with them. The most common use case is entering data and selecting options in a form.

# TL;DR - Too long, didn't read

First things first: you need to [learn to read and interact with form elements](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/how-to-browse-forms){.page title="How to browse forms"} using both screen readers and keyboard-only! We also present you some [quick tools for examining forms](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/quick-tools-for-examining-forms){.page title="Quick tools for examining forms"}.

We then prove that [HTML delivers you everything you need](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/general-forms-example){.page title="General forms example"} to create basic accessible forms:

- A pretty exhaustive list of controls like text input, file upload, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.
- Labels to describe the inputs
- Fieldsets to group inputs and legends to describe them

This is followed by a [demonstration about what typically can go wrong](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/bad-forms-example){.page title="Bad forms example"} when developers aren't mindful and forget about proper semantics.

Further on, we show [how fieldsets and legends should be used](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/grouping-form-inputs-using-fieldset-and-legend){.page title="Grouping form inputs using fieldset and legend"} and [how to fake them - if necessary - using ARIA](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/faking-fieldset--legend-using-aria){.page title="Faking fieldset / legend using ARIA"}. Sometimes it's also desirable to [mix headings](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/grouping-form-inputs-using-headings){.page title="Grouping form inputs using headings"} and [other non-interactive content](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/placing-non-interactive-content-into-forms){.page title="Placing non-interactive content into forms"} into forms.

User input validation is an important topic: we show [how to display validation errors and associate them to inputs](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/validations-and-error-messages){.page title="Validations and error messages"}, [how to mark inputs as "required"](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/marking-inputs-as-required-using-asterisks---){.page title="Marking inputs as required using asterisks (*)"}, and [how to use HTML5 client-side validations](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/html5-client-side-validations){.page title="HTML5 client-side validations"}.

We agree that sometimes it's desirable to [mix form elements into tables](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/forms-in-tables){.page title="Forms in tables"}.

Think you need a fancy widget? Read this first, we show [how to transform basic form controls into fancy looking (and feeling) custom controls](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/advanced-visual-stylings-of-basic-form-controls){.page title="Advanced visual stylings of basic form controls"} - all without using JavaScript!

Talking about JavaScript: sometimes it's necessary that [form controls adapt to user input](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/changing-form-fields-dynamically-based-on-user-input){.page title="Changing form fields dynamically based on user input"}.

Finally, the [FAQ](/code-examples/forms--validations--and-error-messages/faq---frequently-asked-questions){.page title="FAQ - frequently asked questions"} gives answers to many more everyday questions.
