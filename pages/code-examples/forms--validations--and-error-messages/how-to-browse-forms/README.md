# How to browse forms

Browsing forms and interacting with their elements requires some special knowledge in both screen readers and keyboard-only usage.

# Keyboard-only usage

Nothing extraordinary to say here, just be sure to have thoroughly read [How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-keyboard-only-usage/how-to-read-and-interact-with-websites-using-keyboard-only){.page}!

# Screen reader usage

**Important:** The following is only a small refresher! Before you proceed, please be sure to have thoroughly read [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage){.page}!

## Quick navigation

- `Tab`: jump to next focusable element
- `F`: jump to next form element
- `B`: jump to next button
- `X`: jump to next checkbox
- `C`: jump to next combobox
- `R`: jump to next radio button

**Note:** You can add `Shift` to most shortcuts to reverse direction, e.g. press `Shift + Tab` to jump to the **previous** focusable element.

## Interaction with form elements

- `Enter` or `Esc`: enter or exit focus mode (when on editable form element)
    - A distinctive **beep** sound is audible
    - `Insert + Space` is an alternative way to toggle interaction modes (regardless where the cursor is at the moment)
- `Space`: toggle checkbox and expand/collapse combobox
- `Enter`: submit form (on certain form elements, when in focus mode)
- `Enter`: activate button
- `Up` / `Down` (and sometimes `Left` / `Right`)
    - Select radio button value
    - Select element in combobox
