# General data table example

Tables are widely used to display tabular data, and HTML provides everything you need to make them accessible to assistive devices.

The following example provides a very basic table.

Navigate it using table navigation and notice how the screen reader always announces the corresponding data cell's header cell(s):

- If you navigate horizontally (using `Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right`), in addition to the current cell's content, the screen reader also announces the current column's header cell(s)
- If you navigate vertically (using `Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right`), the screen reader announces the current row's header cell(s)

This provides all information needed to browse a table efficiently using a screen reader - easy and effective!
