# How to browse tables

Browsing tables is easily possible using screen readers. On the other hand, keyboard-only doesn't offer any specific interaction.

# Keyboard-only usage

Nothing extraordinary to say here, just be sure to have thoroughly read [How to read and interact with websites using keyboard-only](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-keyboard-only-usage/how-to-read-and-interact-with-websites-using-keyboard-only){.page}!

# Screen reader usage

**Important:** The following is only a small refresher! Before you proceed, please be sure to have thoroughly read [Introduction to desktop screen reader usage](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/introduction-to-desktop-screen-reader-usage){.page}!

## Quick navigation

- `T`: jump to next table

**Note:** You can add `Shift` to most shortcuts to reverse direction, e.g. press `Shift + T` to jump to the **previous** table.

## Table navigation

NVDA and JAWS provide a special navigation within tables:

- `Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right/Up/Down`: navigate to left/right/upper/lower cell

In addition to the content of the current cell, this announces the column's and/or row's header cell(s).
