# Dialog widgets (a.k.a. modal, popup, lightbox, alert)

Dialogs display some information on top of a page.

They are typically used to react upon a user action, e.g. to display a notice or to ask for some input.

There are dialogs that disable the rest of the page in the background (modal), while others don't (non-modal).

**Notice:** dialogs are sometimes also called "modals", "popups", "lightboxes", or even "alerts". All of these terms (incl. "dialog") may be used interchangeably, but they may also refer to different UI concepts (or alternations) sometimes.

Sometimes, a "real" dialog is too much! Maybe a tooltip is enough: [Tooltip widgets](/code-examples/interactive-javascript-and-widgets/tooltip-widgets){.page}?
