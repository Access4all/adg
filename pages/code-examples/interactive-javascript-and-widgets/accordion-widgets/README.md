# Accordion widgets

Accordions contain of a number of content panels, each of wich can be expanded or collapsed vertically by the user.

Accordions help to save vertical space and prevent from visual noise. Some accordions allow only a single one panel to be expanded at a time, others allow multiple.

# Similarities with tablists and carousels

Before you continue, please read [Tablist widgets (a.k.a. tab panels, tabs)](/code-examples/interactive-javascript-and-widgets/tablist-widgets--a-k-a--tab-panels--tabs-){.page} to understand why accordions simply are extended variants of tablists, providing a slightly different layout and (sometimes) expandability of multiple panels.

# Requirements

In addition to the tablists' requirements:

- Multiple panels must be expandable (optional)

Find more detailed requirements here: [WAI-WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices: Accordion (widget)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-wai-aria-practices-20130307/#accordion).

# Proofs of concept

See: [What is a "Proof of concept"?](/code-examples/interactive-javascript-and-widgets/what-is-a-proof-of-concept){.page}

## Radio buttons implementation

Based on the tablists' proof of concept, simply the layout is different.

[**Proof of concept: Accordion**![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/i.cdpn.io/1279260.JOMZXE.small.5ba8271b-8d10-48c0-8617-35f3c8f511ee.png)](https://codepen.io/accessibility-developer-guide/pen/JOMZXE){.code}

## Checkboxes implementation

Based on the tablists' proof of concept:

- The layout is different
- Checkboxes replace the radio buttons to offer multiple selection
    - We waived using a `<fieldset>`/`<legend>` combination, as this is no traditional group of checkboxes (also, JAWS tends to be very wordy with focusable items nested within those)

[**Proof of concept: Accordion Multi**![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/i.cdpn.io/1279260.eeyKgp.small.49eaa56f-7c43-4c5d-8c57-b3020138913b.png)](https://codepen.io/accessibility-developer-guide/pen/eeyKgp){.code}

**Notice:** By default, only the `Space` key is used to toggle a checkbox (while pressing `Enter` submits a form). To make it more intuitive for visual users (who don't know about any checkbox behind the scenes, and thinking they're interacting with a link or button), the `Enter` key was re-wired to also toggle the checkboxes.

## Simple ARIA implementation

It's relatively simple to create a custom carousel implementation using simple ARIA: Just add a link around each panel's header, and an `aria-expanded` attribute. Then toggle its value (`true`/`false`) and the visibility of the corresponding panel using JavaScript!

[**Accordion: Proof of concept**![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/i.cdpn.io/1279260.vWpWmq.small.59afb197-3c42-4e1d-80a2-911ce179ac16.png)](https://codepen.io/accessibility-developer-guide/pen/vWpWmq){.code}

While this may feel tempting in some circumstances, there are several drawbacks:

- It needs more JavaScript (instead of relying on browser standard behaviour)
- This solution is less intuitive: a screen reader announcement "link X collapsed" is less expressive than "show panel X checkbox not checked" or "show panel X radio button not checked 2 of 3"
- Missing backwards compatibility for older clients with incomplete/missing ARIA support

So in line with [Our Codex About Clean and Maintainable Accessibility](/knowledge-about-developing-and-testing-accessible-websites/our-codex-about-clean-and-maintainable-accessibility){.page}, we urge you to always favour browser standard behaviour over ARIA.
