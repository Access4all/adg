# Hiding elements from screen readers using aria-hidden

Hiding elements from screen readers means that an element visually is perceivable, but screen readers ignore it.

This can be achieved by using `aria-hidden="true"` on an element like this:

Important: all child elements will also be hidden! So it's not possible to change this manually by setting `aria-hidden="false"` on a child element:

# Danger: Don't try this with focusable elements!

You shouldn't use `aria-hidden` on focusable elements, as during usage of a screen reader's focus mode, focusable elements are still reachable by the browser, which leads to strange (or missing) announcements of focusable elements with `aria-hidden="true"`.
