# Images, Icons, and Alternative Texts

A lot of information on the internet is conveyed through graphical objects - which a screen reader is unable to interprete. How can adequate alternatives be provided in textual form?

- **Browsing images <sup>to do</sup>** - browse images of different types
  - **Purely decorative images <sup>to do</sup>** - how to hide them from screenreaders
  - **Complex images <sup>to do</sup>** - explore different ways of describing them properly
  - **Browsing scalable vector graphics (SVG) <sup>to do</sup>** - these cool things can be very accessible
  - **Images in links <sup>to do</sup>** - what alternative text is appropriate?
  - **Logos / home page links <sup>to do</sup>** - two purposes in one!
  - **HTML5 figure/figcaption <sup>to do</sup>** - how to make sure it's backwards compatible
  - **A lot more to come here soon (hopefully)**
