# Portable Document Format (PDF)

To find out, whether a PDF is accessible:

Open it in JAWS. When the following dialog is displayed, the PDF isn't tagged at all:

![Read non-tagged document with assistive technology dialog](_media/read-non-tagged-document-with-assistive-technology.png){.image}

Or use PAC's screen reader preview feature.
