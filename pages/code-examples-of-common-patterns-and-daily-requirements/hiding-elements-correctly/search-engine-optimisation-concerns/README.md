# Search engine optimisation concerns

# The past: hiding stuff to trick search engines

In earlier days, visually hidden elements have been used excessively to trick search engines (e.g. by placing visually hidden key words on the page). When this fraud was detected, search engines began to punish such strategies with lower page rankings.

# Today: hiding stuff to serve everybody

Nowadays, search engines have become much smarter: they rely heavily on valid semantics of information. In this respect, they can be compared very closely to users with special needs.

As such, we claim: everything that's good for users with special needs can be treated as good practice for search engine optimisation.
