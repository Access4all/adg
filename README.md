## Vision

The vision behind the Accessibility Developer Guide is to bridge the gap between providers of websites and users with special needs. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both beginners looking for a pragmatic way to dive into the world of accessibility, as well as seasoned experts wanting to extend their knowledge and embracing new inspirations.

The main audience is web developers, but also testing staff, content editors, project managers, etc. may benefit from it.

The Accessibility Developer Guide is a community driven resource and Open Source: everybody is welcome to become a part in the movement of making the internet a more accessible place.
